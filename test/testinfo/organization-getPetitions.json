The funding that our Nation provides to UNICEF is critical to UNICEF's innovative and effective child survival programs.  In addition, the U.S. contribution helps UNICEF respond to humanitarian crises (as in Haiti, Pakistan, and the Horn of Africa), and to address threats to children such as trafficking and sexual exploitation.\n \nIn partnership with the United States, our investment in UNICEF an in child survival makes a huge difference in the lives of poor children worldwide.  UNICEF just announced that the number of children under the age of five dying each day from preventable diseases dropped to 21,000 in 2010 – that’s 12,000 fewer child deaths per day than in 1990!\n \nDespite this significant achievement, the fact is that too many children still die from preventable diseases, too many children cannot attend school, and too many children suffer from exploitation and abuse.  U.S. leadership and funding helps UNICEF to be an effective partner with the United States on child-focused initiatives that Americans support.\n \nAs the House and Senate work to finalize funding for FY 2012, please support $132.25 million for UNICEF in the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations. The U.S. contribution to UNICEF is one of the most worthwhile investments in children we can make with our foreign assistance dollars. Please let me know that you support this funding.\n \nThank you for considering my request. I look forward to hearing from you.",

Child marriage is more common in rural settings than in urban ones and more common in poor families than in wealthier ones. Education is critical; women with primary education are significantly less likely to be married as children than those who received no education.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Child marriage often leads to separation from family and friends, lack of freedom, and decreased opportunities for education and economic participation.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Because early marriage is usually tied to early pregnancy, girls married at a young age also face serious health risks - a girl under age 16 is five times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than a woman between the ages of 20 to 24.</p>\r\n<p>Though the United States supports many programs that assist children and mothers, there is no specific U.S. Government focus on the problem of child marriage.</p>\r\n<p>Bipartisan legislation in both the House of Representatives and the Senate would bolster U.S. efforts to prevent child marriage.

Girls under age 16 are five times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than women ages 20 to 24; girls ages 16 to 19 are twice as likely to die during pregnancy or childbirth as women in their twenties. In addition, childhood pregnancy leads to stunting for both mother and baby, often irreversible.\n\nThere are proven approaches that help communities around the world abandon the practice of child marriage. Although the United States supports many programs that assist children and mothers, there is no specific U.S. Government strategy or funding to tackle the problem of child marriage. This bipartisan legislation would change that, requiring the United States to develop a strategy to help prevent child marriage and help protect girls' health and education. In addition, it authorizes U.S. foreign assistance programs that focus on preventing child marriage.\n\nHelp ensure that our Government is a leader in addressing child marriage.",

Girls can attend school instead of spending hours every day fetching water.</p>\r\n<p>Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Bob Corker (R-TN) introduced the bipartisan Senator Paul Simon Water for the World Act (S. 641). This bill would strengthen America's ability to build partnerships to provide clean water and sanitation to 100 million of the poorest people in the world. This legislation builds on the landmark Water for the Poor Act of 2005, which at long last made safe drinking water and sanitation a priority of U.S. foreign development assistance.</p>\r\n<p>It's important to note that S. 641 does not propose new and costly water programs. In fact, the U.S. Government already provides significant funding to improve access to clean water and sanitation in poor countries. This bill does establish a specific goal: reach 100 million people with first-time access to clean drinking water and sanitation. It calls for global cooperation on research and technology development and provides seed money to spur the deployment of clean water and sanitation technologies.</p>\r\n<p><strong>We take clean water for granted but nearly 900 million people around the world can&rsquo;t.

Diarrhea and disease caused by lack of safe water and poor sanitation kill 4,000 children a day worldwide.\n\nAccess to clean water does more than just save lives, it can turn lives around. When children no longer struggle with recurring illness, they can go to school and get an education. Girls, especially, often miss out on school because they spend hours every day fetching water from distant sources. When schools lack appropriate sanitation facilities, girls are more likely to drop out. UNICEF reports that over half of the world's schools lack safe water and sanitation.\n\nI believe that zero children should die or miss school from the lack of clean water. Senators Durbin and Corker introduced bipartisan legislation to reinforce U.S. investment in water and sanitation worldwide. S. 641 does not propose funding a new and expensive program; rather, it would make current programs more efficient and better targeted. The bill would help a hundred million people have access to safe water and improved sanitation.\n\nPlease help save the lives of children around the world by cosponsoring S. 641. I look forward to your response. Thank you for your consideration. ",
