Our work is accomplished through a collaborative tapestry of individuals, non-governmental organizations, corporate partners, faith-based organizations, the media, grass-roots groups, and children themselves, all of whom have joined UNICEF to help shape a world where the basic needs and human rights of every child are realized.  A world where all children share in the joy and promise of childhood, realizing their rights to dignity, security, and self-fulfillment.<br />Since 1947, we have provided more than $1.6 billion in cash and Gifts-in-Kind (donated supplies and services) to assist UNICEF?s lifesaving programs.",
